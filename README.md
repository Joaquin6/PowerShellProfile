# PowerShell Profile

This repo hosts my PowerShell profile. It's yours to investigate and steal bits and pieces from, though I'm not going to accept issues or PRs on it. It's not intended for copy/paste magic instant reuse. There is no warranty, expressed or implied. It may or may not work on all versions of Windows. It may or may not work in PowerShell Core on any given day. It may be totally broken. It may not be super thoroughly documented. Don't worry about it, it's my profile, not yours.

The profile assumes certain modules are installed. You can see those listed at the top of the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file. There is not an installer for them, but they all come out of the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com) so it shouldn't be hard to get them.

I generally have this checked right in `C:\Users\tillig\Documents\WindowsPowerShell` so it becomes the profile. Makes it easy to push changes up when needed.

I don't really use the PowerShell ISE so that one is likely not up to date. I use other editors like VS Code for my scripting; or I'll use the PS prompt.
